# Decentralized-Task-Manager

A simple blockchain-based task manager where users can add tasks. Demonstrates basic blockchain concepts like task ownership and timestamps.

## Tech Stack:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend + blockchain simulation)

Solidity (smart contract in contracts/TaskLedger.sol)

Python + Web3 (backend simulation in backend/app.py)

## How blockchain is applied:

Each task is recorded with a simulated blockchain account and timestamp.

Frontend JS simulates task immutability and blockchain behavior.

Solidity contract shows how tasks could be stored on a real blockchain.
